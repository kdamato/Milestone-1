This is the classic game of jeopardy. From the homepage you should be able to choose your choice of which category of film Jeopardy you would like to play!

Once you have clicked the link to the version of Jeopardy you'd like to attempt click on each box one at a time and answer the questions to your best ability! Make sure when you put your answer in: "A", "B", "C" or "D" to make sure it is capitalized to ensure you get the correct response! As each question is answered or cancelled, the box with the numerical points value will disappear. If you get the answer correct the game will add to your Score tracker at the top of the screen! If you get the answer incorrect you will not be rewarded any additional score. Now lets play some Jeopardy!
